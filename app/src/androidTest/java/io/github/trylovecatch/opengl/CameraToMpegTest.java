//20131106: removed unnecessary glFinish(), removed hard-coded "/sdcard"
//20131205: added alpha to EGLConfig
//20131210: demonstrate un-bind and re-bind of texture, for apps with shared EGL contexts
//20140123: correct error checks on glGet*Location() and program creation (they don't set error)

/**
 * Record video from the camera preview and encode it as an MP4 file.  Demonstrates the use
 * of MediaMuxer and MediaCodec with Camera input.  Does not record audio.
 * <p>
 * Generally speaking, it's better to use MediaRecorder for this sort of thing.  This example
 * demonstrates one possible advantage: editing of video as it's being encoded.  A GLES 2.0
 * fragment shader is used to perform a silly color tweak every 15 frames.
 * <p>
 * This uses various features first available in Android "Jellybean" 4.3 (API 18).  There is
 * no equivalent functionality in previous releases.  (You can send the Camera preview to a
 * byte buffer with a fully-specified format, but MediaCodec encoders want different input
 * formats on different devices, and this use case wasn't well exercised in CTS pre-4.3.)
 * <p>
 * The output file will be something like "/sdcard/test.640x480.mp4".
 * <p>
 * (This was derived from bits and pieces of CTS tests, and is packaged as such, but is not
 * currently part of CTS.)
